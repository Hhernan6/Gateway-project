      <h3>Our history</h3>
      <div class="history">
        <img src="img/Horacio.jpg" alt="Founder of Snares and Drums" >
        <p>Founded in 2018, Snares and Toms serves to fill the void mainstream music stores seem to leave out, the drum section. A store dedicated solely to the art of drumming, Snares &amp; Toms delivers a wide variety of products. The founder Horacio Hernandez, a drum musician, wanted to build a company that dedicates its time and resources to only drummers. He decided to create this company because he saw that music stores that sold a lot of products did not really pay attention to the drum department. He went on to create the company and store. He made the location of the store in Charlotte, N.C. The store was a success and he plans on opeining other stores very soon.</p>

We want to be reliable when it comes to shopping at our store. We always want to be there when you need a new drum kit, cymbals, drumheads, and so on. We always want to be there when you need it the most. We believe that for a company to be great, it need to treat its customer with respect and professionalism. That is why we commit to always bringing the best service. Loyalty, our most important core value. The store was made for the sole purpose of only selling drum related products. We want to stay loyal to our customer, drummers. We at Snares &amp; Toms never want to sell non-related products. If we ever do, we are not following our core values and most importantly, we fail our customers. </p>
